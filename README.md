## Installation Guide

[Download this repository](https://github.com/Gaftherman/My-Custom-Dropper/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract it's contents inside `Steam\steamapps\common\Sven Co-op\svencoop\`

That should look like this:

```

            └── 📁Gaftherman
                └── 📄Dropper.as       
```

Now, in the default_plugins.txt. 

> In the case you don't know where is the default_plugins.txt x[
```
└── 📁svencoop
     └── 📄default_plugins.txt

Add this
```
"plugin"

	"name" "Dropper"
	"script" "Gaftherman/Dropper"
} 
```

And there is, you installed my Custom Dropper. 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉

## What is new/changed in this script?

- 💡Now supports custom ammunitions.

- 💡I added a way to hide the ammunition dropped. You just need to put in the chat ``hidedropammo``.

- ⚠️This use a custom entity, so you need to restart the map for it to work properly.
